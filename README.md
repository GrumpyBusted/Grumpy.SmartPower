# Grumpy.SmartPower
Smart Power is an application for smarter control of the power consumption in my house.
After I got solar panels and house battery installed in my home, I found that the 
logic built in to the system did consider the price of electricity. And because I live in Denmark
where we don't have that must sun during the winter, it some times make sence to charge the
battery from the grid. Grid power are cheep during night hours and expensive in the evening, by 
controlling when to save power from the grid and when to use saved power, I am able to use less
money on power. This application automate this process!
